Four Pillars of OOP

Encapsulation
parang capsule
yan ung nilalagay mo sya sa isang method

Inheritance 
parang mother and father pwede manganak
ung anak is another object
Can be inherit

Polymorphism 
ung paggamit ng overloaded methods

Abstraction
With abstract class, you cannot instanciate the class as you can only use 1 method.
And in that method, every child class of that method HAS to provide their own implementation

Example: makeSound();

notice that this method doesn't use any brackets because this method doesn't have any implementations.
