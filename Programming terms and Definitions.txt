Programming Terms:


1 Syntax - The structure of the code: words, punctuation, and symbols 

	How do we print Hello World! in different programming languages?
       - Java = System.out.println("Hello World!");
       - C# = Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
       - Python = print("Hello World!")

	//They have the SAME FUNCTION that prints Hello World text on the console
	//Programming Languages are similar, but not that much 

2. Algorithm - a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task
	  - step-by-step process of example: How to Cook an Egg  

3. Source code - The whole code of the project

4. Class - blueprint for creating objects
      - in Java, it is also the name of your file : Main.java
5. Methods - block of code which only runs when it is called Ex. myMethod(){}
6. Objects - is created from class
7. Variables - containers for storing variables  ( String myVar = "Variable" )
8. Data Types - (String, Int, Boolean, Double) defines the type of variable
9. Arrays - Used to store multiple values in a single variable
       - String[] place = {"Naguilian","Bauang", "San Fernando", "San Juan", "Bacnotan"};


Examples: 

Class
	Main.java

Methods 
	myMethod(){

	    System.out.printLn("Hello World");

	}

Variables

	Declaration - 		String name
	Assignment - 		name = "GitHub";
	Initialization - 	String name = "GitHub"
